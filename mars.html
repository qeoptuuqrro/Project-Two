              How does a planet lose its atmosphere? Is it possible to recreate or force one once lost? How is it different than what we’ve done to Earth as a species?

            <div class="answer">
             <p>Mars lost some of its atmosphere when its internal magnetic field died as the internal liquid iron-nickel core froze. With no magnetic field, the solar wind started stripping away the atmosphere. Also, the atmosphere was converted into rocks by weathering—for example, perhaps making limestones (calcium carbonate). And very light elements, like hydrogen, can just escape from the gravitational pull of the planet. Earth is not losing much of its atmosphere to space because our planet still has an outer core of liquid iron and nickel. This makes a strong magnetic field that keeps the solar wind from stripping away our atmosphere. Also, volcanoes keep replenishing some atmospheric gases.</p>

              What’s the warmest place on Mars? If/when we colonize Mars, why wouldn’t we colonize at that warm place?

             <p>The equator in low regions would be warmest, particularly if the places are dark and absorb a lot of sunlight. These might be good places for a human expedition.</p>

              Why was Mars able to sustain lakes and rivers ages ago, but cannot now? Isn’t it too cold, and wasn’t it always?

            <div class="answer">
             <p>Warm wet areas today on Mars are likely to be subsurface deposits of liquid water and ice. In the past, Mars had active volcanoes. These emitted gases that kept the atmosphere warm and wet by greenhouse warming. Also, it had long ago a magnetic field that kept the solar wind from stripping away the protective atmosphere.</p>

              If we were to sublimate both polar ice caps on MARS (via nukes or any means) would we create an atmosphere? Would Mars be more habitable?

            <div class="answer">
             <p>Making the poles of Mars sublimate (go from ice to vapor) by heating them would put both carbon dioxide and water vapor into the atmosphere. However, it is likely that these gases would then react with rocks and be consumed over time. For example, carbon dioxide dissolved in liquid water makes carbonic acid, which is a main reason that rocks are Earth are chemically weathered. The carbon is converted into limestone and taken out of the atmosphere.</p>
